# Config File

The [dotnet tool](/MarkdownSnippets#installation) and the [MSBuild Task](msbuild.md) support a config file convention.

Add a file named `msdnippets.json` at the target directory with the following content:

<!-- snippet: sampleConfig.json -->
```json
{
  "WriteHeader": true,
  "ReadOnly": false,
  "LinkFormat": "Tfs",
  "Exclude": [ "Dir1", "Dir2" ],
  "UrlsAsSnippets": [ "Url1", "Url2" ]
}
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/ConfigReader.Tests/sampleConfig.json#L1-L7)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->
