# Config File

The [dotnet tool](/MarkdownSnippets#installation) and the [MSBuild Task](msbuild.md) support a config file convention.

Add a file named `msdnippets.json` at the target directory with the following content:

<!-- snippet: sampleConfig.json -->
```json
{
    "WriteHeader" : true,
    "ReadOnly" : false
}
```
<sup>[snippet source](/src/ConfigReader.Tests/sampleConfig.json#L1-L4)</sup>
<!-- endsnippet -->
