# Table of contents

If a line is `toc` it will be replaced with a table of contents

So if a markdown document contains the following:

<!-- snippet: tocBefore.txt -->
<a id='snippet-tocBefore.txt'></a>
```txt
# Title

toc

## Heading 1

Text1

## Heading 1

Text2
```
<sup><a href='/docs/mdsource/toc/tocBefore.txt#L1-L11' title='File snippet `tocBefore.txt` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-tocBefore.txt' title='Navigate to start of snippet `tocBefore.txt`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

The result will be rendered:

<!-- snippet: tocAfter.txt -->
<a id='snippet-tocAfter.txt'></a>
```txt
# Title

<!-- toc -->
## Contents

 * [Heading 1](#heading-1)
 * [Heading 2](#heading-2)
<!-- endToc -->

## Heading 1

Text1

## Heading 2

Text2
```
<sup><a href='/docs/mdsource/toc/tocAfter.txt#L1-L16' title='File snippet `tocAfter.txt` was extracted from'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-tocAfter.txt' title='Navigate to start of snippet `tocAfter.txt`'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->


## Heading Level

Headings with level 2 (`##`) or greater can be rendered. By default all level 2 and level 3 headings are included.

To include more levels use the `--toc-level` argument. So for example to include headings levels 2 though level 6 use:

```ps
mdsnippets --toc-level 5
```


## Ignore Headings

To exclude headings use the `--toc-excludes` argument. So for example to exclude `heading1` and `heading2` use:

```ps
mdsnippets --toc-excludes heading1:heading2
```
