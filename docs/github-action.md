# GitHub Actions

Markdown snippets can be run inside a [GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions) by installing and using [MarkdownSnippets.Tool](/readme.md#installation). This can be useful to ensure md docs are in sync when .source files are edited online, and without needing to re-generate d docs locally.

Add the following to `.github\workflows\on-push-do-doco.yml` in the target repository.

<!-- snippet: on-push-do-docs.yml -->
<a id='snippet-on-push-do-docs.yml'></a>
```yml
name: on-push-do-docs
on:
  push:
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run MarkdownSnippets
      run: |
        dotnet tool install --global MarkdownSnippets.Tool --version 20.0.0-beta.1

        branch="${GITHUB_REF:11}"
        git push "${remote}" ${branch} || echo "nothing to push"
